## Description
Weekend Code Challenge #4

This project consisted of displaying pictures of one's life on the DOM. When a picture is clicked a description of the picture is displayed on the DOM instead of the picture. When the description is clicked the picture replaces the description on the DOM. There is also a button that, when clicked, increases the count of how many times it was clicked. The button is for "liking" the picture. 

REACT was used to develop the client side of the solution. No work was necessary on the server side for base mode. The data consisted of four fields; an id, a picture, a description and the number of likes.
Two terminals were open while working on the project. npm run server and npm run client. The server ran on port 5000 and the client ran on port 3000. VS Code was used as an editor.
